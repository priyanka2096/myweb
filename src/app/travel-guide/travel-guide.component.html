         museums and art galleries, botanical gardens, buildings and structures (such as forts, castles, libraries, former prisons, skyscrapers, bridges), 
         theme parks and carnivals, living history museums, public art (sculptures, statues, murals), signs[clarification needed], ethnic enclave
